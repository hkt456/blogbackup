# Preface

Welcome to my second post on HTML! If you're new here, make sure to check out our previous blog - "Introduction to HTML - Part 1."

Previously, we explored the history of HTML and actually coded our first website. However, our page only consisted of texts. In this post, we will go deeper into the capabilities of HTML in using images,...

## Images

In the last post, we already learned how to use simple tags like `<h1></h1>` or `<p></p>`,... for text formats. Let me introduce you to `<img></img>`

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is my first HTML web!<h1>
    <h2>The reasons why I should learn HTML</h2>
    <p>It is the frontend backbone of website development</p>
    <p>It is easy!</p>
    <img src="imgs/programmerbear.png">
    <h2>Why it is so fun to learn HTML</h2>
    <p>Because this blog is so detailed!</p>
    <p>Just kidding!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Above is our code from the previous post, but this time, I have added an image.

By adding

```xml
<img src="imgs/programmerbear.png">
```

Within the `<body></body>` tags, I was able to attach an image to our page. Now to scale the image to make it looks better, we just need to add the "width" and "height" attribute:

```xml
<img src="imgs/programmerbear.png" width="50%" height="50%">
```

## Buttons

To give our website some more functions, we can add buttons using the `<button></button>` tags

Code:

```xml
<button>Click me</button>
```

Output:

Of course, the button doesn't really have any value to it because we haven't assigned any particular functions. But hey, we will explore how to do so as we explore the functionalities of CSS and Javascript in the future!

## Input

Hypothetically, our webpage needs a feedback section where visitors will type in their thoughts. Now, we will need to create a place for them to type in their text, and to do so, we will use the `<input></input>` tag!

Code:

```xml
<input type="text" placeholder="Share us your thoughts!">
```

Output:

The `<input>` tag seems different because it has some attributes!
