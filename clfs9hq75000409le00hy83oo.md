Hello to anyone who is reading this. My name is Huỳnh Khắc Tâm, and I am from VNU-HCM High school for the Gifted. Welcome to my first-ever blog!

This blog will be mainly about my journey as an English major trying his hardest to become a professional AI researcher/Developer and my development as a 17-year-old Vietnamese boy trying to understand dynamic programming.

For my first post, I thought I'd share a little bit more about myself and what inspired me to start this blog. I've only coded for a year, but it wasn't until recently that I cropped up the courage to put it to actual use and share it with the community. Through my journey, I am learning more about myself as a programmer and a human as I explore the vast world of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence coming from a rather "Linguistic" background.

My target audience is other fellow high school students struggling to figure out what they want to do in life and how to learn what they love. Whether you are a veteran programmer or just wrote your first "Hello World" program, I hope that you will find some value here.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more!
